# Sales Insights Dashboard for a Computer Hardware Business


**Description:** 
Developed a Power BI dashboard to provide real-time sales insights for a computer hardware business, enabling data-driven decision-making in a dynamic market. This project encompassed the entire data analysis lifecycle, from data discovery and ETL to dashboard creation, stakeholder feedback, and mobile optimization.

**Introduction:**
A computer hardware industry is characterized by rapid changes and intense competition.  To maintain a competitive edge, the Sales Director recognized the need for real-time sales insights. This project aimed to address this need by creating an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides key performance indicators (KPIs) and facilitates a deeper understanding of sales trends.

**Methodology:**
1. **Project Planning & Data Discovery:**  Defined project scope, objectives, and success criteria using the AIMS grid. Identified the MySQL database as the primary data source for sales transactions, customer information, product details, and market data.
2. **ETL & Data Cleaning:** Established a connection between Power BI and the MySQL database. Performed ETL operations (data munging/wrangling) to transform and clean the data. This included currency normalization and handling invalid values to ensure data quality and consistency.
3. **Power BI Dashboard Development:** Designed and developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key sales metrics and provide actionable insights.  The initial dashboard included visualizations of sales by product category, sales by region, total revenue filterable by month and year. 
4. **Dashboard Refinement & Iteration:** Incorporated additional stakeholder feedback to enhance the dashboard.  For example, based on feedback, implemented a pie chart to visualize top clients' revenue contribution and addressed specific requests like highlighting revenue decline from specific clients. This iterative approach ensured the dashboard aligned with business needs.
5. **Publishing & Sharing:** Published the finalized Power BI dashboard to the cloud, making it accessible via the Power BI website.  Enabled features such as report export (PDF, PowerPoint), personal bookmarks, interactive report bookmarks, and scheduled database synchronization to ensure data freshness.
6. **Mobile Optimization:** Created a mobile-friendly version of the dashboard for access via the Power BI mobile app, providing convenient on-the-go access to sales insights.


**Results:**
* **Increased Data Accessibility:** The interactive Power BI dashboard provided the Sales Director and sales team with immediate access to critical sales data, eliminating the need for manual report generation and significantly reducing the time required to analyze sales performance.
* **Improved Decision-Making:**  The real-time insights provided by the dashboard facilitated more informed and timely decision-making.  For example, the ability to quickly identify declining revenue from specific clients allowed for proactive intervention and relationship management.
* **Enhanced Sales Performance Tracking:** The dashboard provided a comprehensive overview of sales performance across different dimensions (product, region, customer), enabling better tracking of progress towards sales targets and identification of areas for improvement.  This will improve sales target achievement in the following quarter.
* **Streamlined Reporting Process:** Automating the reporting process through the Power BI dashboard saved the sales team an estimated 20 hours per month, freeing up time for other strategic activities.
* **Increased Transparency:** The shared dashboard fostered greater transparency within the sales organization, as all stakeholders had access to the same consistent view of sales performance.


**Technologies Used:**
* Power BI
* MySQL


**Conclusion:**
This project successfully delivered a valuable tool for the computer hardware business, empowering the sales team with real-time insights and facilitating data-driven decision-making. The iterative approach, incorporating additional stakeholder feedback, ensured the dashboard effectively addressed the business needs and contributed to improved sales performance.  This project demonstrates my ability to manage the full data analysis lifecycle, from data acquisition and cleaning to visualization and communication of insights.
